# React Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built using React.

## Overview

This project serves as a showcase for my skills, projects, and experience. It's designed to be easily customizable and deployable.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server. This will open the app in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
5. Begin making changes to the code. The page will reload automatically when changes are made.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject`: This is a one-way operation. Use with caution as it removes the single build dependency and allows full control over configuration files.
